#Instructions

Use the arrow keys to change the direction of the GloWorm.  Do no hit any walls or yourself.  

Eat red apples to increase your score but watch out!  You'll grow longer every time you do.

Eat green apples.  Eat one of these to increase your score AND cut your length in half!

Beware of toxic blue apples.  They will double your length and decrease your score.

The more apples you eat, the faster the game will get.

#Have Fun!
