#Description
This is a browser friendly version of the classic mobile game snake with a twist!.  Written in JavaScript.

#Instructions
* Use the arrow keys to change the direction your GloWorm.  Do no hit any walls or yourself.  
* Red apples increase your score but watch out; you'll grow longer each time you eat one.
* Green apples increase your score and cut your length in half.  
* Beware the toxic blue apples!  They will decrease your score and double your length!
* The more apples you eat, the faster the game will get.

#Implementation
* Extended the Array.prototype with `#equals` for array comparison
* Set cookie with jsCookie to persist user's highscore
* Keybindings with keymaster.js


#Have Fun!
