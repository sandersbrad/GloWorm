This is a browser friendly version of the classic mobile game snake with a twist!.  Written in JavaScript.

#Instructions

Use the arrow keys to change the direction your GloWorm.  Do no hit any walls or yourself.  

Red apples increase your score but watch out; you'll grow longer time you eat one.

Green apples increase your score and cut your length in half.  

Beware the toxic blue apples!  They will decrease your score and double your length!

The more apples you eat, the faster the game will get.

#Have Fun!
